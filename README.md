# Django Framework Tutorial Project

### Project Overview

This project is a Django-based web application created to serve as a video tutorial for learning and understanding the Django framework. As part of our **Advanced Python** course, we were tasked with creating a video to explain the fundamentals of Django. To make the concepts more engaging and digestible, we combined theoretical explanations with a practical example: building a web-based calculator.

### Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to:

1. **Introduce Django’s Core Concepts**: Explain foundational elements like views, templates, models, and URL routing.
2. **Demonstrate with a Practical Example**: Walk through building a basic calculator app to apply Django’s features in a real-world context.
3. **Simplify Complex Ideas**: Break down the setup and execution of Django applications into simple, understandable steps.

Our tutorial emphasizes key Django features such as:
- Views and templates for dynamic content
- Form handling
- URL routing
- Separation of front-end and back-end logic

   cd django_tutorial
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. **Install dependencies:**
